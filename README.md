# Webpack App
 
## Introduction:
 
Welcome to the **Webpack App**. This is a Webpack template that can be used for a Vanilla JS application or if you wish you can add your favorite Framework/Library.

***
 
### Prerequisites
 
* You need to have **NodeJS** installed - this app is running in the node *version: 10.15.1*.
* You need to have **npm** or **yarn** installed.
* You need to run **npm install** to download the dependencies (i.e. Webpack & Webpack Web Server).
 
***
 
## Getting Started
 
Once you clone this repo and install all the dependencies, you can run the Webpack App by the following command: **npm start**. You can amend webpack.common.js config file to add Typescript, JSX or another loaders that you need for your Application.
 
***
 
## Webpack and Production
 
For development, as we mentioned you can run the dev server with the command **npm start**. To generate files for production you can run **npm run build** which will create a dist folder with all the main html, css and js files optimized (minify).
 
***
 
## Dependencies for Development
 
* [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) to bundle javascript, html, css and images files.
* [Webpack-Web-Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) serves a Webpack app in localhost://9000.
